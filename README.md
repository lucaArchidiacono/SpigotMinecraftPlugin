# SpigotMinecraftPlugin

For this Plugin you need a Minecraftserver.

Afterwards copy paste the .jar file into the "plugins" folder.

Now you should try to start the Minecraftserver.

Open the Minecraft Application and choose your localhost server.

Aaaannnnddd then have fun with my Plugin ;)

Add this command line /createMagicStick.

Now you should have received a stick. Make a right click with your Minecraft-Character.

In a radius from 100 Blocks every teammate is throwing his item to you.
The item will be removed from the inventory from your teammates and instead you will have it in your inventory.
